# Twitter_Data_Pipeline
This is and  End-To-End Data Engineering Project using Airflow and Python. This project originally involved extracting data using Twitter API, but now that the API is no longer free to access, I downloaded the twitter dataset from Kaggle and  used python to transform the data, deployed the code on Airflow/EC2 and saved the final result on Amazon S3
